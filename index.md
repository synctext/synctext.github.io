**Imagine** a world in which robots do all the work.

**Imagine** the life in which you never need to work. Your life is a permanent vacation, you can watch television endlessly or spend time on permanent road trips. Imagine never retiring, because there is no need to retire.

**Imagine** a world where robots have taken all the jobs. All of them. Robots do all our dirty work, all our mindless office jobs, they make our food, everything. This future has arrived. Delft University of Technology has realised a key milestone for the robot economy. Cardinal question is: **Who will own all those robots?** We can now democratically control _any_ amount of money and coordinate any economic activity.

**Imagine** a fully automated factory, company, or country with honest democratic rule. Robots as incorruptible saints, the first seed for capitalism on steroids. Free from leadership, overhead, and outdated regulations you can manage millions in (Bitcoin) assets. Grow a community, make a profit, make decisions, conduct votes, and free yourself of hierarchy. Create your own organisation in the cloud, free of lawyer fees, technology lock-in, Big Tech dependency, and government censorship. Total existential freedom.

## Details
We developed technology to promote social change concerning institutions, companies, infrastructures and resources.
Our technology tries to alter the essence of capitalism. Our micro-economy of robots offers benefits to everybody and is democratically ruled, not owned by any elite.
Our technology is designed to withstand all known government attacks, lawyer-based attacks, and cooperate interest.
Our technology is based on smartphones which can transmit money and information freely and are under democratic oversight. 

- Transformation of society
- Equal ownership for all and meaningful control and participation in the means of production
- Access to capital, knowledge, and resources necessary to start any economic activity
- Full transparency and democratic governance with stability and predictability

## Screens and Features

We implemented collective ownership of _any_ sum of Bitcoins with democratic rule. With freedom to code we facilitate any economic activity with these Bitcoins.
